        <h3>2. Introduction</h3>
        <p>The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What questions are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those questions important?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>3. Data Curation</h3>
        <p>Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>4. Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>(See checkpoint 2.)</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>5. Primary Analysis</h3>
        <p>Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you answer the questions you posed in the introduction. Explain your reasoning.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>6. Visualization</h3>
        <p>Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least one plot. Make sure that every element of the plots is labeled and explained (donâ€™t forget to include a legend!).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>7. Insights and Conclusions</h3>
        <p>After reading through the project, does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like they learned more about it?</p>
        <p>If needed, you may add subsections.</p>

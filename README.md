## Contributions:
For each member, list which of the following sections they worked on, and summarize the contributions in 1-2 sentences. Be specific!
- **A:** Project idea
- **B:** Dataset Curation and Preprocessing
- **C:** Data Exploration and Summary Statistics
- **D:** ML Algorithm Design/Development
- **E:** ML Algorithm Training and Test Data Analysis
- **F:** Visualization, Result Analysis, Conclusion
- **G:** Final Tutorial Report Creation
- **H:** Additional (not listed above)

## 2. Introduction
The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What questions are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those questions important?

## 3. Data Curation
Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import kagglehub
import pandas as pd
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, LabelEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
```

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
(See checkpoint 2.)




## 5. Primary Analysis
Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you answer the questions you posed in the introduction. Explain your reasoning.

## 6. Visualization
Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least one plot. Make sure that every element of the plots is labeled and explained (donâ€™t forget to include a legend!).

## 7. Insights and Conclusions
After reading through the project, does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like they learned more about it?

If needed, you may add subsections.
